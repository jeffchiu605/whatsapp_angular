Angular2-Meteor-WhatsApp
-----------------------

WhatsApp 
- [meteor](meteor.com)
- [angular2](angular.io)

This app was created using 'angular' CLI. The same result could be achieved using `meteor`'s CLI, but I also wanted to go through the bundling process using `webpack`, therefore `meteor`'s build system would have prevented me from doing so. A `meteor` CLI version of this tutorial might be implemented in the future.

A step-by-step version of this app exists in the [step-by-step branch](github.com/DAB0mB/ionic2-meteor-messenger/tree/step-by-step), and it's tutorial is written in the [tutorial dir](github.com/DAB0mB/ionic2-meteor-messenger/tree/master/tutorial) of this repository. A blog post with a very detailed explenasion about each step is available at [angular-meteor's official website](angular-meteor.com/tutorials/whatsapp2/ionic/setup), and a video tutorial series can be found on [Youtube](youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfEFEil62pk3dRXiC6sI--V1aVDkOW0Ls).
